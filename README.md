This project implements a parking sensor system using an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between a vehicle and an obstacle (e.g., a gate). The system provides visual and audible warnings to the driver, helping them avoid collisions.

How It Works
The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to an obstacle.
Based on the distance:
0 - 25 cm: Red LED turns on, and a long buzzer sound indicates a dangerous distance.
26 - 40 cm: Yellow LED turns on, and a short buzzer sound warns of a medium distance.
> 40 cm: Green LED turns on, indicating a safe distance.
The system updates the readings and warnings in real-time.
Instructions
Power the system.
Observe the LED indicators and listen for the buzzer to gauge the distance to nearby obstacles.
